Question a: The di.sh first initiates the shell script by #!/bin/bash then 
executes 1 command line argument inputted by $1.

./di.sh "ls -l" 
The above command makes ls -l only one input argument despite the blank space
, since wrapping with double quotation marks are interpreted.

Question b:
initial guess: 
(variable A set as a)
(variable B set as 1)
(variable C set as [a][1]C = a1C)
(variable D set as [1]*10 = 1*10, since all strings)
echo a 1 a1C 1*10

initial print:
a 1 a1C 1*10

answer print:
a 1 a1C 1*10
