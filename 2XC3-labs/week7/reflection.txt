I think the advantage to pointer arithmetic is the benefit of using
the value of an array, almost like an index. Being able to add to a
pointer and index the next value is much easier than calculating
with indices. However, it also brings a disadvantage that indexing 
is less clear, and much more easier to cause out of bound errors,
like segmentation fault accessing and leaking extra memory.

I would say I prefer indexing over pointer arithmetic, since I have
been using indexing in much more other languages, and it is overall
a higher level of control of the array data.
