In my first 2XC3 lab about the linux environment, I learned how to create files with vim in the terminal, how to nagivate between directories using paths, and manipulating files in a directory like removing or listing. I'm excited to learn more about coding and pushing changes to github using the terminal. However, I am concerned about if the future labs can be done with a mac m1 laptop.
