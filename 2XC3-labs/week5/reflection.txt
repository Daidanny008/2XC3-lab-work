In terms of C in comparison to Python, I think its lower-level controls and primitive types allows it to run much faster than Python. Yet, along with that, coding in C is much more restrictive in aspects like casting to different types, predetermining size of a string, and more specific syntax in general. Hence, C is much faster in runtime, but I usually prefer Python for competitions since there are more tools and options with simpler syntax.
